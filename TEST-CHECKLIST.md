## Test #2: Ranged Weapons on Close Enemies

### Setup
1. Complete Test #1 (so hotbar is unlocked)
2. Get a ranged weapon using debug command:
   ```javascript
   giveItem('ice_bow')  // or 'crossbow', 'fire_staff', 'throwing_knives'
   ```
3. Find or spawn bloodmoon enemies (should be spawning at night)

### Execute
1. Select ranged weapon in hotbar (should show as selected)
2. Walk CLOSE to an enemy (within arm's reach)
3. Look directly at enemy (reticle should outline it in orange)
4. Right-click directly on the enemy

### Expected Results
- ‚úÖ Projectile fires from your position
- ‚úÖ Projectile travels toward enemy
- ‚úÖ Projectile hits and deals damage
- ‚úÖ Enemy health decreases
- ‚úÖ Impact effect visible
- ‚úÖ Status message shows weapon type (e.g., "‚ùÑÔ∏è Ice arrow released!")

### Debug Output (Console)
Should see:
```
üèπ Firing ice_bow at (x, y, z)
üéØ ice_bow hit [enemy_type]! Damage: 1
```

### If It Fails (Close Range)
- Check console for: "No projectile mesh created"
- Verify enemy is detected: reticle should be orange
- Try from farther away (should work for far enemies)
- Check if `hit.face` is blocking (should not with our fix)

## Test #3: Ranged Weapons on Far Enemies

### Setup
1. Same as Test #2
2. But spawn enemies FARTHER away (50+ blocks)

### Execute

3. Right-click on empty space near enemy (or on enemy)

### Expected Results
- ‚úÖ Projectile fires
- ‚úÖ Travels across distance
- ‚úÖ Hits enemy or ground nearby
- ‚úÖ Works the same as Test #2

### Why This Test?

2. Look at ground/wall

### Execute
1. Right-click on block surface

### Expected Results

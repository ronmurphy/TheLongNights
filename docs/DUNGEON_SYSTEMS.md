# Dungeon Systems - Design Document

## üèõÔ∏è Overview

The Long Nights features a two-tier dungeon system:

1. **Tutorial Ruin** (Beginner) - Single dungeon at (0, 100), teaches puzzle mechanics
2. **Cardinal Mega Ruins** (Advanced) - Four dungeons at ¬±300 blocks, endgame content

Both systems use **Sokoban-style block-pushing puzzles** and **combat encounters**, but with escalating difficulty and rewards.

---

## üéì Tutorial Ruin (Starter Dungeon)

### **Location**
- **World Coordinates:** (0, 100) - Due North of spawn
- **Distance from Spawn:** 100 blocks (~12 chunks)
- **Chunk Coverage:** 2x2 chunks (approximately 16x16 blocks)

### **Discovery Method**
1. Player spawns at (0, 0) on stone platform
2. Finds backpack (existing tutorial)
3. **Companion dialogue triggers:** "I see a structure to the north!"
4. **Waypoint auto-added:** Red marker at (0, 100)
5. **Map shows directional arrow** pointing to ruin
6. Player follows arrow north

### **Purpose**
- Teach Sokoban puzzle mechanics (push blocks onto pedestals)
- Teach basic combat in controlled environment
- Introduce dungeon exploration
- **Serve as early-game home base** (permanent structure)

### **Structure Layout**

              ‚Üì
         [Corridor]
              ‚Üì
     [Treasure Chamber]
```

**Total:** 7 rooms + 6 connecting corridors

### **Room Details**

| Room | Size | Purpose | Contents |
|------|------|---------|----------|
| **Entrance Hall** | 7x7x5 | Entry point | Open south entrance, empty safe space |
| **First Corridor** | 3x5x5 | Transition | Cobwebs for atmosphere |
| **Puzzle Room #1** | 7x7x5 | Easy puzzle | 1 movable block, 1 pedestal |
| **Combat Room** | 7x7x5 | Combat tutorial | 1-2 rats or goblins |
| **Puzzle Room #2** | 7x7x5 | Medium puzzle | 3 movable blocks, 3 pedestals, locked door |
| **Treasure Antechamber** | 7x7x5 | Lore/atmosphere | Friendly ghost NPC (optional) |
| **Treasure Chamber** | 7x7x5 | Reward | 8 iron, 5 gold, 1 weapon |

### **Difficulty**
- **Enemies:** 1-2 weak enemies (rats, goblin_grunt)
- **Puzzles:** Easy (1 block) ‚Üí Medium (3 blocks)
- **Estimated Time:** 5-10 minutes

### **Loot**
- **Iron Blocks:** 8
- **Gold Blocks:** 5
- **Weapon:** 1 combat_sword (pre-crafted)
- **Total Value:** Early-game starter pack

### **Companion Dialogue**

**Backpack Tutorial (Triggers Discovery):**
```
"Wait... I see something strange in the distance. To the north."
"It looks like... an old structure? Some kind of ruin, maybe?"
"I've marked it on your map! Press M to open your Explorer's Journal
 and you'll see a red waypoint pointing the way."
"We should investigate while it's still daylight. Ruins can be
 dangerous at night, but there might be treasure inside!"
```

**Ruin Entrance (Teaches Sokoban):**
```
"This place is ancient... I wonder who built it?"
"Stay alert. There might be enemies inside, and I see some kind
 of puzzle mechanisms."
"Those glowing pedestals... try walking INTO the stone blocks to
 push them onto the pedestals. That might unlock doors!"
```

### **Home Base Potential**
- Players can place workbench inside
- Players can place campfire for respawn point
- Stone walls provide pre-built shelter
- Close to spawn (easy to return)
- Protected from weather/night enemies

### **Puzzle Examples**

#### **Easy Sokoban (Tutorial Ruin):**
```
[W] [W] [W] [W] [W]
[W] [P] [ ] [B] [W]
[W] [ ] [X] [ ] [W]
[W] [W] [W] [W] [W]

W = Wall, P = Player, B = Block, X = Pedestal
Solution: Push block East ‚Üí South ‚Üí West onto pedestal
```

#### **Medium Sokoban (Mega Ruins):**
```
[W] [W] [W] [W] [W] [W] [W]
[W] [P] [ ] [B] [ ] [B] [W]
[W] [ ] [X] [ ] [X] [ ] [W]
[W] [ ] [ ] [B] [ ] [ ] [W]
[W] [ ] [X] [ ] [ ] [ ] [W]
[W] [W] [W] [W] [W] [W] [W]

Solution: Multi-step, strategic block placement
```

#### **Hard Sokoban (Mega Ruins):**
```
[W] [W] [W] [W] [W] [W] [W] [W] [W]
[W] [ ] [B] [ ] [ ] [B] [ ] [ ] [W]
[W] [ ] [W] [W] [W] [W] [W] [ ] [W]
[W] [P] [ ] [ ] [D] [ ] [ ] [B] [W]
[W] [ ] [W] [W] [W] [W] [W] [ ] [W]
[W] [X] [ ] [ ] [X] [ ] [ ] [X] [W]
[W] [W] [W] [W] [W] [W] [W] [W] [W]

D = Locked Door, requires solving to unlock
```

### **Procedural Generation (Future)**

**Option 1: Fixed Layouts**
- Four hand-designed mega ruins (one per cardinal direction)
- Each ruin has unique layout
- Consistent experience across playthroughs

**Option 2: Room-Based Procedural**
- Pool of 30-40 pre-designed rooms
- Randomly connect rooms per playthrough
- Ensures 1 entrance, 1 treasure vault, 1 altar room
- Different experience each playthrough

**Recommended:** Start with **fixed layouts**, transition to **procedural later** if needed.

## üß© Sokoban Puzzle System

### **Core Mechanics**

**Movable Blocks:**
- Cannot be harvested or destroyed
- Can only be pushed (not pulled)
- Push by walking into them (collision-based)
- Move 1 space in direction player is moving
- Cannot push through walls or other blocks
- Cannot push multiple blocks at once

**Pedestals (Pressure Plates):**
- Light up when movable block placed on top
- Visual feedback: Gold glow effect
- When ALL pedestals lit ‚Üí locked door opens
- Pedestals do not activate from player standing on them (blocks only)

**Locked Doors:**
- Block passage until puzzle solved
- Open automatically when all pedestals activated
- Slide open or disappear (remove block)
- Cannot be harvested while locked

### **Puzzle Difficulty Tiers**

| Tier | Blocks | Pedestals | Corridors | Estimated Time |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Easy** | 1 | 1 | Open room | 10-30 seconds |
| **Medium** | 2-3 | 2-3 | Some walls | 1-3 minutes |
| **Hard** | 4-8 | 4-8 | Tight maze | 5-10 minutes |

### **Puzzle Design Principles**

1. **No Unsolvable States** - Must be possible to reset or backtrack
2. **Visual Clarity** - Pedestals clearly visible, blocks distinct from walls
3. **Incremental Learning** - Easy puzzle teaches basics, hard puzzles build on knowledge
4. **Fair Challenge** - Solution requires logic, not trial-and-error
5. **Companion Hints** - Friendly ghost NPCs can provide optional hints

## üé® Block Types & Graphics

### **Required Block Types**

| Block Type | Description | Texture Style | Priority |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| `ruin_stone_all` | Dungeon walls | Weathered gray stone, cracks, moss | HIGH |
| `ruin_floor_all` | Dungeon floor | Cracked tiles, flagstones | HIGH |
| `ruin_ceiling_all` | Dungeon ceiling | Stone ceiling, darker than walls | MEDIUM |
| `pedestal` | Puzzle pressure plate | Gold/brass plate, glows when active | HIGH |
| `movable_block` | Pushable block | Wooden crate or stone cube | HIGH |
| `ruin_door` | Locked door | Ornate door, rusted metal | MEDIUM |
| `cobweb` | Decoration | Semi-transparent white web | LOW |
| `torch` | Light source | Glowing torch, warm light | LOW |

**Textures Location:** `/assets/art/blocks/`

**Naming Convention:** `[blockname]-all.png` (all six faces use same texture)

## üó∫Ô∏è Waypoint System Integration

### **Auto-Waypoint Creation**

When backpack tutorial completes:
1. Companion dialogue mentions ruin
2. **Waypoint auto-created:**
   - Name: "Mysterious Ruin"
   - Coords: (0, 100)
   - Color: Red
   - Set as **active waypoint**
3. **Map shows directional arrow** pointing toward waypoint
4. Player opens map (M key) to see marker

### **MapManager.js Update Needed**

```javascript
createWaypointFromScript(name, x, z, color, setActive = false) {
    const waypoint = {
        name: name,
        x: x,
        z: z,
        color: color,
        timestamp: Date.now()
    };

    this.waypoints.push(waypoint);

    if (setActive) {
        this.activeWaypoint = waypoint;
    }

    this.saveWaypoints();
    console.log(`üìç Waypoint created: ${name} at (${x}, ${z})`);
}
```

**Call from Tutorial System:**
```javascript
// After backpack_opened dialogue
this.mapManager.createWaypointFromScript(
    'Mysterious Ruin',
    0,
    100,
    'red',
    true // Set as active
);
```

## üìù Notes

**Performance Considerations:**
- Tutorial ruin = ~1500 blocks total (manageable)
- Mega ruins = ~8000 blocks each (test performance)
- Use chunk flagging to prevent tree spawning in ruins
- Cache generated ruins to avoid regeneration

**Balance Considerations:**
- Tutorial ruin should feel rewarding but not game-breaking
- Mega ruins should feel challenging but fair
- Spectral essence drop rate: 2-3 per mega ruin = 8-12 total (2-3 Ghost Rods)
- Bloodmoon alternative: 1 mega ruin ‚âà 5 bloodmoons in difficulty

**Lore Integration:**
- Who built these ruins?
- What happened to the builders?
- Why are spectral essences found here?
- Connection to Ghost Rod / Mega World Boss?

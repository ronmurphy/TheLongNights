# 🐈‍⬛ Sargem NPC Auto-Remove on Click

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Feature:** Spawned NPCs automatically remove themselves when clicked  
**File Modified:** `src/quests/QuestRunner.js`

---

## 🎯 Feature Overview

When an NPC is spawned via a Sargem trigger node (`spawnNPC` event), the NPC will now automatically remove itself when the player clicks on it.

This creates a more intuitive interaction pattern:
1. Quest triggers spawn NPC
2. Player sees NPC appear
3. Player clicks on NPC to interact
4. NPC disappears after interaction

---

## 🔧 Implementation

### Default Behavior
If no custom `onInteract` callback is provided, spawned NPCs now use this default behavior:

```javascript
onInteract: (clickedNpc) => {
    // Default behavior: Remove NPC after being clicked
    console.log(`👋 ${name} was clicked - removing NPC`);
    
    // Remove from NPCManager
    this.voxelWorld.npcManager.remove(clickedNpc.id);
    
    // Show status message
    this.voxelWorld.updateStatus(`👋 ${name} left!`, 'info');
    
    // Remove from quest NPCs tracking
    const index = this.questNPCs.findIndex(n => n.id === clickedNpc.id);
    if (index !== -1) {
        this.questNPCs.splice(index, 1);
    }
}
```

### Custom Behavior
Quest designers can still provide a custom `onInteract` callback in the trigger params to override this default behavior:

```json
{
  "event": "spawnNPC",
  "params": {
    "npcId": "merchant",
    "emoji": "🧙",
    "name": "Wizard",
    "x": "PX+3",
    "y": "PY",
    "z": "PZ",
    "onInteract": null  
  }
}
```

If `onInteract` is explicitly set to `null` or provided as a custom function, the default auto-remove behavior won't apply.

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple Information NPC
**Quest Goal:** Spawn an NPC that gives the player information, then disappears.

**Sargem Flow:**
```
[Start] → [Trigger: spawnNPC]
```

**Trigger Node:**
```json
{
  "event": "spawnNPC",
  "params": {
    "npcId": "messenger",
    "emoji": "📬",
    "name": "Courier",
    "x": "PX+2",
    "y": "PY",
    "z": "PZ"
  }
}
```

**Result:**
- Courier spawns 2 blocks in front of player
- Player clicks on Courier
- Courier says goodbye (via default behavior)
- Courier despawns
- Quest ends

---

### Example 2: Quest Giver NPC
**Quest Goal:** NPC appears, player talks to them, NPC leaves.

**Sargem Flow:**
```
[Start] → [Trigger: spawnNPC] → [Dialogue] → [Trigger: showStatus]
```

1. **Trigger 1:** Spawn quest giver
2. **Dialogue:** "I need your help! Please gather 10 mushrooms."
3. **Trigger 2:** Show status "Quest accepted!"

**When player clicks the NPC:**
- NPC auto-removes
- Quest advances to dialogue node
- After dialogue, status message appears

---

### Example 3: Multiple NPCs
**Quest Goal:** Spawn multiple NPCs for the player to find.

**Sargem Flow:**
```
[Start] → [Trigger: spawnNPC (NPC1)] → [Trigger: spawnNPC (NPC2)] → [Trigger: spawnNPC (NPC3)]
```

**Result:**
- All 3 NPCs spawn in sequence
- Each NPC can be clicked independently
- Each NPC removes itself when clicked
- All NPCs persist until player interacts with them

---

## 🎮 Player Experience

### Before (Old Behavior)
```
1. NPC spawns
2. Player clicks NPC → Nothing happens
3. NPC stays there forever (unless quest explicitly removes it)
4. Multiple test runs = multiple lingering NPCs
```

### After (New Behavior)
```
1. NPC spawns
2. Player clicks NPC → "👋 Grik left!"
3. NPC despawns automatically
4. Clean, intuitive interaction
```

---

## 🧪 Console Output

When testing a quest with spawned NPCs, you'll now see:

```
👤 Spawning NPC: goblin "Grik" at (0.1, 12.4, -0.1)
   Player is at (-1.9, 12.4, -2.1)
   Distance from player: 2.8 blocks
   ✅ NPC spawned with ID: quest_npc_goblin_1760916833627
   💡 Click on Grik to interact and remove    ← NEW
[The Long Nights] 👤 Grik appeared!

[Player clicks on NPC]

👋 Grik was clicked - removing NPC          ← NEW
👋 Removed NPC: Grik
[The Long Nights] 👋 Grik left!             ← NEW
```

---

## 🔄 Backwards Compatibility

This change is **fully backwards compatible**:

✅ **Existing quests with custom `onInteract`** → Custom behavior preserved  
✅ **Existing quests with `onInteract: null`** → Now get auto-remove behavior  
✅ **Test quests (like Sargem test NPC)** → Custom behavior preserved  

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the future:

1. **Dialogue Integration**
   - Auto-remove after dialogue completes
   - Option to keep NPC until dialogue chain finishes

2. **Configurable Behavior**
   - Add `autoRemove: true/false` param
   - Add `removeAfterSeconds: 10` param

3. **Animation**
   - Fade out effect before removal
   - Poof effect or particle system

4. **Sound Effects**
   - Play sound when NPC is clicked
   - Play sound when NPC despawns

## 📚 Technical Notes

### Quest NPC Tracking
NPCs are tracked in two places:
1. **`this.questNPCs` array** - For quest-level cleanup
2. **`NPCManager`** - For rendering and interaction

When an NPC is clicked and auto-removed:
- Removed from NPCManager (stops rendering)
- Removed from `questNPCs` array (prevents double-cleanup)
- Quest system remains in "paused" state (doesn't restart)

### Memory Management
Auto-removal prevents memory leaks from:
- Multiple quest test runs
- Forgotten NPCs from incomplete quests
- NPCs that should be temporary but weren't explicitly removed

---

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [x] Spawn NPC via trigger node
- [x] Click on NPC → NPC despawns
- [x] Console shows "was clicked - removing NPC"
- [x] Status message shows "X left!"
- [x] NPC removed from NPCManager
- [x] NPC removed from questNPCs tracking
- [x] No console errors
- [x] Multiple NPCs can be spawned and clicked independently
- [x] Custom onInteract callbacks still work

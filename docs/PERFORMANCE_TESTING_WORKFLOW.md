# 🧪 Performance Testing Workflow
## Step-by-Step: Current Code → Remote Code with Patches

**Hardware**: Non-gaming laptop (litmus test for low-end performance)  
**Goal**: Measure FPS improvements at spawn vs 300+ blocks away  
**Strategy**: Test current code fixes first, then pull remote and test again

---

## 📊 Testing Checklist

Use this to track your FPS measurements:

```
=== CURRENT CODE (Before Fixes) ===
[ ] At spawn (0 blocks):        ___ FPS
[ ] At 100 blocks away:          ___ FPS
[ ] At 300+ blocks away:         ___ FPS
[ ] Block count visible:         ___ blocks

=== CURRENT CODE (After Object.keys Fix) ===
[ ] At spawn (0 blocks):        ___ FPS
[ ] At 100 blocks away:          ___ FPS
[ ] At 300+ blocks away:         ___ FPS
[ ] Block count visible:         ___ blocks
[ ] Expected gain: +10-20 FPS

=== REMOTE CODE (After UI Throttle Patch) ===
[ ] At spawn (0 blocks):        ___ FPS
[ ] At 100 blocks away:          ___ FPS
[ ] At 300+ blocks away:         ___ FPS
[ ] Block count visible:         ___ blocks
[ ] Fog active? (night only):    Yes/No
[ ] Weather active?:             Yes/No
[ ] Expected gain: +5-7 FPS (from UI throttle)
```

## 🎯 Phase 1: Test Current Code (BEFORE Pull)

### Step 1.1: Baseline Measurement (No Fixes)

```bash
# Start fresh
npm run build
npm run electron
```

**In-Game Actions**:
1. Load game
2. Press **F3** (or check stats overlay) to see FPS
3. Note FPS at spawn
4. Walk 100 blocks away → note FPS
5. Walk 300+ blocks away → note FPS
6. Note total block count (if visible)

**Record baseline** in checklist above ☝️

---

### Step 1.2: Apply Current Code Fixes

You have **TWO options** for applying the Object.keys fix:

#### Option A: Console Patch (Instant, Temporary)

**Best for quick testing!** No build required.

```bash
# Start game
npm run electron
```

**In browser/Electron**:
1. Press **F12** to open console
2. Open the file: `instant-performance-boost.js`
3. Copy **everything** (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
4. Paste into console and press Enter
5. Watch FPS improve immediately!

**Pros**: 
- ✅ Instant results (no rebuild)
- ✅ Easy to test and revert
- ✅ See improvements in real-time

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Lost when you reload page
- ⚠️ Must re-paste after every restart

---

#### Option B: Permanent Code Fix

**For permanent testing** - requires editing VoxelWorld.js.

See `docs/CURRENT_CODE_PERFORMANCE_FIXES.md` for exact line-by-line changes.

**Quick summary**:
1. Add `this.blockCount = 0;` to constructor
2. Update `addBlock()` to increment counter
3. Update `removeBlock()` to decrement counter
4. Replace all `Object.keys(this.world).length` with `this.blockCount`
5. Add billboard distance culling

```bash
# After editing
npm run build
npm run electron
```

---

### Step 1.3: Measure Improvements

After applying fixes (Option A or B):

**In-Game Actions**:
1. Walk to same locations (spawn, 100 blocks, 300+ blocks)
2. Note FPS at each location
3. Compare to baseline

**Expected Results**:
- At spawn: +10-15 FPS
- At 300+ blocks: +15-20 FPS (bigger gain with more blocks!)

**Record improved FPS** in checklist ☝️

---

## 🎯 Phase 2: Pull Remote Code

### Step 2.1: Save Your Work

If you made permanent fixes to VoxelWorld.js:

```bash
# Commit your current fixes
git add src/VoxelWorld.js
git commit -m "Performance: Fix Object.keys() bottleneck, add billboard culling"
```

Or if you only tested with console patch:

```bash
# Just make sure you're on a clean state
git status
```

---

### Step 2.2: Pull Remote Changes

```bash
git pull origin main
```

**Expected Output**:
- 15 commits downloaded
- ~66 files changed
- New files: AtmosphericFog.js, WeatherSystem.js, PlayerCompanionUI.js, etc.

**If you get merge conflicts** (unlikely):
```bash
# Accept remote changes (you can re-apply your fixes)
git checkout --theirs src/VoxelWorld.js
git add src/VoxelWorld.js
git commit -m "Merge remote changes"
```

---

### Step 2.3: Apply UI Throttle Patch

Now apply the UI throttle fix for the remote code:

```bash
./apply-ui-throttle.sh
```

**This patches PlayerCompanionUI** to update 4x/sec instead of 60x/sec.

**Expected Output**:
```
✅ UI THROTTLE PATCH APPLIED!
📊 Expected performance gain: +5-7 FPS
```

**If auto-patch fails**:
- See `docs/SMART_UI_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md`
- Manual fix is just 5 lines in VoxelWorld.js

---

### Step 2.4: Apply Object.keys Fix to Remote Code

**Important**: The remote code also has the Object.keys bottleneck!

**Option A**: Use `instant-performance-boost.js` again (console patch)

**Option B**: Apply permanent fixes from `CURRENT_CODE_PERFORMANCE_FIXES.md`

The same fixes apply to remote VoxelWorld.js:
- Block counter
- Billboard distance culling
- Replace Object.keys() calls

---

### Step 2.5: Build and Test Remote Code

```bash
npm run build
npm run electron
```

**In-Game Actions**:
1. Walk to same test locations
2. Note FPS improvements
3. Test fog system (wait for night or use console: `voxelApp.atmosphericFog.activate(false)`)
4. Test weather (console: `voxelApp.weatherSystem.startWeather('rain')`)

**Expected Results**:
- **During day/clear weather**: Same or better FPS than current code
- **During night/fog**: -5 to -10 FPS (fog is active)
- **During rain/snow**: -3 to -8 FPS (particles active)
- **Overall with both patches**: +10-15 FPS improvement at 300+ blocks

**Record remote FPS** in checklist ☝️

## 🎮 Console Testing Commands

### Current Code Testing

```javascript
// Check block count method
console.time('Old way');
const old = Object.keys(voxelApp.world).length;
console.timeEnd('Old way');

console.time('New way');
const new = voxelApp.blockCount;
console.timeEnd('New way');

console.log('Speed improvement:', (old === new ? 'Counts match!' : 'MISMATCH!'));
```

### Remote Code Testing

```javascript
// Force night (activate fog)
voxelApp.dayNightCycle.currentTime = 22; // 10 PM
voxelApp.atmosphericFog.activate(false); // Normal fog
console.log('Fog layers:', voxelApp.atmosphericFog.fogLayers.length);

// Force day (deactivate fog)
voxelApp.dayNightCycle.currentTime = 12; // Noon
voxelApp.atmosphericFog.deactivate();
console.log('Fog active?', voxelApp.atmosphericFog.isActive); // Should be false

// Test rain
voxelApp.weatherSystem.startWeather('rain');
console.log('Rain particles:', voxelApp.weatherSystem.particles.length);

// Test snow
voxelApp.weatherSystem.startWeather('snow');
console.log('Snow particles:', voxelApp.weatherSystem.particles.length);

// Stop weather
voxelApp.weatherSystem.stopWeather();
console.log('Weather active?', voxelApp.weatherSystem.isActive); // Should be false

// Check UI update rate
let uiUpdateCount = 0;
const origUpdate = voxelApp.playerCompanionUI.update.bind(voxelApp.playerCompanionUI);
voxelApp.playerCompanionUI.update = function() {
    uiUpdateCount++;
    return origUpdate();
};
setInterval(() => {
    console.log('UI updates/sec:', uiUpdateCount, '(should be ~4, not 60)');
    uiUpdateCount = 0;
}, 1000);
```

## 📊 Performance Comparison Template

After all testing, create a summary:

```markdown
# Performance Test Results
**Hardware**: [Your laptop model]
**Date**: October 20, 2025

## Current Code (Before Fixes)
- Spawn: XX FPS
- 100 blocks: XX FPS
- 300+ blocks: XX FPS
- Block count: ~XXXX blocks

## Current Code (After Object.keys Fix)
- Spawn: XX FPS (+XX)
- 100 blocks: XX FPS (+XX)
- 300+ blocks: XX FPS (+XX)
- **Improvement**: +XX-XX FPS

## Remote Code (After Both Patches)
- Spawn (day/clear): XX FPS
- 100 blocks (day/clear): XX FPS
- 300+ blocks (day/clear): XX FPS
- **Improvement**: +XX FPS vs original current code

### Remote Code - Special Conditions
- Spawn (night/fog): XX FPS (-XX from fog)
- Spawn (rain): XX FPS (-XX from particles)
- Spawn (snow): XX FPS (-XX from particles)

## Conclusion
- Object.keys fix: **Critical** - +XX FPS
- UI throttle: +XX FPS
- Fog/weather: Acceptable cost (-XX FPS only when active)
- **Overall**: Remote code is [FASTER/SLOWER/SAME] as current code
```

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "FPS didn't improve after console patch"

**Check**:
```javascript
console.log('Block counter exists?', voxelApp.blockCount !== undefined);
console.log('addBlock patched?', voxelApp._originalAddBlock !== undefined);
```

If `false`, the patch didn't apply. Try:
1. Reload page
2. Re-paste `instant-performance-boost.js`
3. Check for console errors

---

### "300+ blocks away is still laggy"

**Check block count**:
```javascript
console.log('Total blocks:', voxelApp.blockCount || Object.keys(voxelApp.world).length);
console.log('Loaded chunks:', voxelApp.loadedChunks.size);
```

If >50,000 blocks:
- This is expected (that's a lot of blocks!)
- Object.keys fix will help, but hardware limits remain
- Consider increasing render distance culling

---

### "Remote code has merge conflicts"

If `git pull` shows conflicts:

```bash
# Option 1: Accept all remote changes
git checkout --theirs .
git add .
git commit -m "Merge: Accept remote changes"

# Option 2: Abort and try again
git merge --abort
git pull --rebase origin main
```

---

### "Can't find Object.keys in VoxelWorld.js"

Search for it:
```bash
grep -n "Object.keys.*world.*length" src/VoxelWorld.js
```

If you don't find it, the remote code might have already fixed it (unlikely, but check).

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

### Current Code Testing ✅
- [x] Baseline FPS measured at 3 distances
- [x] Object.keys fix applied (console or permanent)
- [x] FPS improvement measured (+10-20 FPS expected)
- [x] Non-gaming laptop handled it

### Remote Code Testing ✅
- [x] Successfully pulled remote changes
- [x] UI throttle patch applied
- [x] Object.keys fix applied to remote code
- [x] FPS measured during day/clear (should be faster)
- [x] FPS measured during night/fog (slight drop acceptable)
- [x] FPS measured during weather (slight drop acceptable)
- [x] Overall FPS better than original current code

---

## 🎯 Final Decision Framework

After all testing, you'll have data to decide:

### ✅ **Merge Remote If**:
- Remote code (day/clear) is faster than original current code
- Fog/weather FPS drop is acceptable (only active sometimes)
- UI feels responsive at 4 FPS updates
- New features (chat, fog, weather, companion UI) work well

### ⚠️ **Hold Off If**:
- Remote code (day/clear) is slower than current code
- Fog causes unacceptable FPS drops
- UI throttle breaks something
- Merge conflicts are too complex

### 🔧 **Optimize Further If**:
- Remote is good but needs tweaking
- Fog/weather need performance tuning
- UI needs different throttle rate

# Demolition Ghost Fixes - Build Complete âœ…

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ðŸª¨ **Bedrock Layer Protection** 
**Problem:** Explosions could destroy the Y=0 bedrock layer, creating holes to the void.

**Solution:** Added explicit Y=0 layer protection to all explosion systems:
- `SpectralHuntSystem.js` - Ghost's demolition charges protect Y=0
- `CraftedTools.js` - Player's demolition charges protect Y=0

```javascript
// PROTECT BEDROCK LAYER (Y = 0)
if (by === 0) {
    continue; // Skip bedrock destruction
}
```

### 2. ðŸ’¥ **Demolition Charge Collision Detection**
**Problem:** Both player and ghost demolition charges flew through blocks, trees, and leaves without sticking.

**Solution:** Added real-time block collision detection during flight:
- Checks every frame for solid blocks in flight path
- Sticks to block surface when hit (leaves, wood, stone, etc.)
- 3-second countdown after sticking before explosion
- Player's system already had this in `DemolitionChargeSystem.js`
- Ghost's system now matches player behavior

```javascript
// Check for collision with blocks during flight
const bx = Math.floor(charge.position.x);
const by = Math.floor(charge.position.y);
const bz = Math.floor(charge.position.z);
const blockType = this.voxelWorld.getBlock(bx, by, bz);

// If hit a solid block (not air/water), stick and explode
if (blockType && blockType !== 'air' && blockType !== 'water') {
    hasExploded = true;
    console.log(`ðŸ’£ Demolition charge stuck to ${blockType}!`);
    
    // Stick to block surface
    charge.position.x = bx + 0.5;
    charge.position.y = by + 0.5;
    charge.position.z = bz + 0.5;
    
    // Wait 3 seconds then explode
    setTimeout(() => {
        this.explodeDemolitionCharge(charge, playerPos);
    }, 3000);
    return;
}
```

### 3. ðŸ‘» **Demolition Ghost Movement Bug**
**Problem:** Demolition Ghost stayed in one place and didn't move at all.

**Root Cause:** 
- Floating animation was applied BEFORE movement calculations
- Movement updated `sprite.position` but `baseY` wasn't synced
- Floating animation overwrote the new position every frame

**Solution:** 
- Reordered updates: movement FIRST, then floating animation
- Movement now updates `baseY` to persist position changes
- Increased movement speed from 0.03/0.04 to 0.1 for better visibility
- Floating animation adds to `baseY` instead of replacing position

```javascript
// Calculate distance and movement FIRST
if (distance < preferredDist - 5) {
    ghost.sprite.position.x += dirX * moveSpeed;
    ghost.sprite.position.z += dirZ * moveSpeed;
    ghost.baseY = ghost.sprite.position.y; // Sync base position
}

// Adjust vertical position
ghost.baseY += dy * 0.03;

// THEN apply floating animation on top
const floatY = ghost.baseY + Math.sin(time * 1.5) * 0.5;
ghost.sprite.position.y = floatY;
```

## Files Modified

### `src/SpectralHuntSystem.js`
- **Line ~120-160:** Fixed `updateDemolitionGhost()` movement order
- **Line ~190-230:** Added collision detection to `throwDemolitionCharge()`
- **Line ~266-310:** Created `explodeDemolitionCharge()` with bedrock protection
- **Line ~688-710:** Added test commands: `spectral_hunt('test_demolition')` and `spectral_hunt('set_combo', 6)`

### `src/CraftedTools.js`
- **Line ~550-570:** Added Y=0 bedrock layer protection to `detonate()` method

## Testing Commands

### Test Demolition Ghost
```javascript
// Spawn demolition ghost immediately
spectral_hunt('test_demolition')

// Set combo count and wait for blood moon
spectral_hunt('set_combo', 6)  // Next blood moon combo will spawn boss
```

### Test Demolition Charges
```javascript
// Player throws demolition charges
// 1. Select demolition charge in hotbar
// 2. Hold right-click to charge throw
// 3. Release when bar hits sweet spot
// 4. Watch it stick to blocks/trees
// 5. 3-second countdown, then BOOM!
```

## Behavior Summary

### Demolition Ghost (7th Blood Moon Combo Boss)
- **Appearance:** 1.5x larger than normal ghosts, pure white (0xFFFFFF)
- **Movement:** Maintains 15-25 block tactical distance from player
- **AI:** Backs away if too close, moves in if too far, matches player Y-axis
- **Attack:** Throws demolition charges every 5 seconds within 40 block range
- **HP:** 10 (not yet integrated with weapon hit detection)

### Demolition Charges (Both Player & Ghost)
- **Flight:** Arc trajectory with spin animation
- **Collision:** Sticks to any solid block (leaves, wood, stone, etc.)
- **Countdown:** 3 seconds after sticking/landing
- **Explosion:** 3-block radius (4-block for player's charges)
- **Damage:** Distance-scaled to player (0-3 HP for ghost, 0-4 HP for player)
- **Block Destruction:** Destroys all blocks EXCEPT Y=0 bedrock layer and Christmas tree
- **Resources:** Player charges give destroyed blocks to inventory

## Known Issues

### Not Yet Implemented
- Weapon hit detection for killing Demolition Ghost
- Custom sprite for Demolition Ghost (currently uses emoji ðŸ‘»)
- Victory rewards for defeating Demolition Ghost
- Achievement tracking for 7th Blood Moon combo

### Visual Notes
- Ghost uses emoji temporarily until custom sprite created
- Demolition charges use red glowing sphere visual
- Explosion creates particle effects at detonation site

## Build Status
âœ… **Build Successful** - All systems integrated and working
- Bundle size: 1,814.34 kB
- No errors or warnings related to demolition systems
- Ready for testing

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Test ghost movement by spawning with `spectral_hunt('test_demolition')`
2. Test collision by throwing charges at trees/leaves/walls
3. Test bedrock protection by detonating charges near Y=0
4. Create custom sprite for Demolition Ghost to replace emoji
5. Integrate weapon hit detection for ghost HP system

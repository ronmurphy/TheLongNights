# Performance Comparison: Local vs Remote Code

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Issue:** Local code (this laptop) runs well, remote code (to pull) has performance issues  
**Goal:** Identify what changed and how to merge without losing performance

---

## Summary

Your local code is **15 commits behind** the remote repository (origin/main). The remote has ~12,000 lines of new code including:

- Weather System with volumetric fog
- Sound Effects System  
- Atmospheric Fog rendering
- Companion Hunt map integration with waypoints
- Desert Pyramids and Tundra Igloos (new structures)
- Multiple UI improvements
- Quest system enhancements

**Key Finding:** Remote version actually has BETTER performance optimizations for structures (reduced spawn rates), but added several rendering-heavy systems that may be causing slowdowns.

## Key Performance Changes in Remote

### ✅ PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS (in remote)

1. **Structure Spawn Rate Reduced**
   - **File:** `src/StructureGenerator.js`
   - **Change:** `STRUCTURE_FREQUENCY = 0.02` (was 0.05)
   - **Impact:** Ruins spawn in ~2% of chunks (was 5%) = 60% fewer ruins
   - **Result:** Less world generation lag

2. **Tree Stamina Bug Fixed**
   - **Commit:** `e4c0a8e`
   - **Change:** Removed tree trunk multiplier (was 20-30x stamina cost)
   - **Impact:** Trees now cost 1-2 stamina instead of 20-60
   - **Result:** Much better gameplay feel

3. **Igloo/Pyramid Spawn Rates**
   - Igloos: 2% spawn in Tundra (small, 8-block radius)
   - Pyramids: 2% spawn in Desert (16-block base)
   - **Impact:** Minimal - these are rare and biome-specific

### ⚠️ PERFORMANCE CONCERNS (new in remote)

1. **AtmosphericFog System** (NEW)
   - **File:** `src/AtmosphericFog.js` (225 lines)
   - **Features:** Volumetric fog rendering during night/blood moon
   - **GPU Cost:** Adds fog shader pass, particle effects
   - **Potential Impact:** 5-15 FPS hit on lower-end GPUs

2. **WeatherSystem + WeatherCycleSystem** (NEW)
   - **Files:** `src/WeatherSystem.js` (352 lines), `src/WeatherCycleSystem.js` (240 lines)
   - **Features:** Rain/snow particles, sound effects, day/night cycle integration
   - **GPU Cost:** Particle systems for precipitation
   - **Potential Impact:** 10-20 FPS hit during active weather

3. **SoundEffectsSystem** (NEW)
   - **File:** `src/SoundEffectsSystem.js` (305 lines)
   - **Features:** Spatial audio, sound preloading
   - **CPU Cost:** Audio processing, distance calculations
   - **Potential Impact:** Minimal unless many sounds playing

4. **Companion Hunt Map Integration**
   - **Changes:** Adds purple markers, companion tracking, waypoint rendering to minimap
   - **GPU Cost:** Additional draw calls per frame for markers
   - **Potential Impact:** 2-5 FPS hit (minor)

## Your Local Additions (Not Yet Pushed)

Based on your description, you've added locally:
- Pyramids (✅ already in remote!)
- Snow spheres (igloos - ✅ already in remote!)
- Lowered tree/ruins % (✅ remote has this too!)
- FPS monitor improvements

**Good news:** Most of your changes overlap with remote, so merge should be clean!

## Performance Bottleneck Analysis

### Most Likely Culprits (from remote code)

**1. Atmospheric Fog (HIGHEST IMPACT)**
```javascript
// src/VoxelWorld.js - Line 397
this.atmosphericFog = null;

// Creates volumetric fog during night/blood moon
// Uses THREE.js fog shaders + particle effects
// RECOMMENDATION: Make this optional/toggle-able
```

**2. Weather System (HIGH IMPACT)**
```javascript
// Adds rain/snow particle systems
// Active during weather cycles
// RECOMMENDATION: Reduce particle count or make optional
```

**3. Multiple New Rendering Systems**
- Chat overlay improvements (visual novel style)
- Companion UI with live portraits  
- Weather particles
- Fog volumes
- Sound spatial calculations

### Frame Budget Analysis

Assuming 60 FPS target (16.67ms per frame):

| System | Estimated Cost | Priority |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| **Base Game** | 8-10ms | Critical |
| **Weather Particles** | 2-4ms | Optional |
| **Atmospheric Fog** | 3-5ms | Optional |
| **Companion Map Markers** | 0.5-1ms | Low |
| **Sound Effects** | 0.5-1ms | Low |
| **Chat/UI Rendering** | 1-2ms | Medium |
| **TOTAL** | 15-23ms | **Over budget!** |

**Result:** On lower-end hardware, you'd drop to 40-45 FPS or worse.

## Recommended Merge Strategy

### Option 1: Selective Merge (RECOMMENDED)

Pull remote changes but **disable performance-heavy features**:

```bash
# 1. Fetch remote changes
git fetch origin

# 2. Merge but keep your local performance
git merge origin/main

# 3. After merge, disable heavy systems in code
```

Then modify these files:

**src/VoxelWorld.js - Disable Atmospheric Fog:**
```javascript
// Line ~397 - Comment out or make conditional
// this.atmosphericFog = new AtmosphericFog(this.scene, this.camera);
this.atmosphericFog = null; // DISABLED for performance
```

**src/VoxelWorld.js - Make Weather Optional:**
```javascript
// Line ~400-ish - Add performance check
const enableWeather = localStorage.getItem('longNights_enableWeather') === 'true';
if (enableWeather) {
    this.weatherSystem = new WeatherSystem(/*...*/);
} else {
    this.weatherSystem = null; // DISABLED for performance
}
```

**Add Performance Menu Option:**
```javascript
// In src/ui/MainMenu.js or settings
// Add toggle for:
// - Atmospheric Fog (ON/OFF)
// - Weather Effects (ON/OFF)  
// - Particle Count (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
```

### Option 2: Branch Strategy

Keep your fast local code on a separate branch:

```bash
# 1. Save your current work
git checkout -b laptop-performance-optimized

# 2. Go back to main and pull
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 3. Cherry-pick performance improvements
git cherry-pick laptop-performance-optimized
```

### Option 3: Full Merge + Optimization Pass

Pull everything, then do an optimization pass:

```bash
# 1. Pull all changes
git pull origin main

# 2. Profile with FPS counter
# 3. Disable systems one by one to find bottleneck
# 4. Commit performance fixes
```

## Quick Performance Fixes to Apply After Merge

### 1. Disable Atmospheric Fog by Default

**File:** `src/VoxelWorld.js`

```javascript
// Find line ~397
this.atmosphericFog = null; // DISABLED - enable in settings if needed

// Or make it FPS-dependent:
if (this.stats && this.averageFPS > 45) {
    this.atmosphericFog = new AtmosphericFog(this.scene, this.camera);
} else {
    console.log('⚠️ Atmospheric fog disabled - low FPS detected');
}
```

### 2. Reduce Weather Particle Count

**File:** `src/WeatherSystem.js` (if you enable it)

```javascript
// Find particle count settings (likely in constructor)
// Reduce from 1000 to 300-500
this.maxParticles = 300; // REDUCED for performance
```

### 3. Limit Companion Map Updates

**File:** `src/CompanionHuntSystem.js`

```javascript
// Only update companion position every 500ms instead of every frame
if (Date.now() - this.lastMapUpdate < 500) return;
this.lastMapUpdate = Date.now();
```

### 4. Add FPS-Based Auto Quality

**File:** `src/VoxelWorld.js` - Add to animate() loop

```javascript
// In animate() function, track FPS
this.fpsHistory = this.fpsHistory || [];
this.fpsHistory.push(1000 / deltaTime);
if (this.fpsHistory.length > 60) this.fpsHistory.shift();

const avgFPS = this.fpsHistory.reduce((a,b) => a+b) / this.fpsHistory.length;

// Auto-disable heavy systems if FPS drops
if (avgFPS < 30 && this.atmosphericFog) {
    console.log('⚠️ Low FPS detected, disabling atmospheric fog');
    this.scene.remove(this.atmosphericFog.fogMesh);
    this.atmosphericFog = null;
}
```

---

## Testing Protocol After Merge

1. **Clear localStorage** (fresh start)
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear()
   ```

2. **Run FPS Benchmark**
   - Walk around spawn for 2 minutes
   - Note average FPS
   - Check console for performance stats

3. **Test with Systems Disabled**
   ```javascript
   // In console, disable one at a time:
   voxelApp.atmosphericFog = null;
   voxelApp.weatherSystem = null;
   voxelApp.sfxSystem.muted = true;
   ```

4. **Compare FPS** before/after each disable

5. **Identify Bottleneck**

---

## File-by-File Performance Impact

### High Impact (Disable First)
- `src/AtmosphericFog.js` - Volumetric fog rendering
- `src/WeatherSystem.js` - Rain/snow particles
- `src/WeatherCycleSystem.js` - Weather state management

### Medium Impact (Optimize)
- `src/ui/Chat.js` - Visual novel style chat (+70 lines)
- `src/ui/PlayerCompanionUI.js` - Live companion portraits (+350 lines)
- `src/CompanionHuntSystem.js` - Map marker updates

### Low Impact (Keep)
- `src/SoundEffectsSystem.js` - Audio is async, minimal CPU
- `src/StructureGenerator.js` - Actually IMPROVED (lower spawn rates)
- `src/VoxelWorld.js` - Most changes are feature additions, not rendering

## Your Specific Questions Answered

### Q: "Can you check what we have on this laptop vs last commit online?"

**A:** You're on commit `9584b99`, remote is on `3343fdd` (15 commits ahead). Remote has:
- Desert pyramids ✅ (you added these locally too)
- Igloo snow spheres ✅ (you added these locally too)  
- Lower ruin spawn rates ✅ (you did this locally too)
- FPS monitor ✅ (exists in both)
- **NEW:** Weather, fog, sound, companion map features

### Q: "How can I fix the new code to perform like this code?"

**A:** The remote code has **better structure spawn rates** than you might think, but added heavy rendering systems. Fix by:

1. **Disable atmospheric fog** (biggest hit)
2. **Make weather optional** (second biggest)
3. **Reduce particle counts** if you keep weather
4. **Add FPS-based quality settings**

### Q: "Did rendering code change somewhere?"

**A:** Yes! Major changes:
- `AtmosphericFog.js` - NEW volumetric fog system
- `WeatherSystem.js` - NEW rain/snow particles
- `Chat.js` - Enhanced visual novel rendering
- Companion map markers - Additional draw calls per frame

**None of these existed in your local version**, which is why it runs better.

## Recommended Action Plan

### Step 1: Backup Your Local Work
```bash
git stash save "Local performance optimizations"
# Or commit to a branch:
git checkout -b before-pull-backup
git commit -am "Backup before pulling remote changes"
git checkout main
```

### Step 2: Pull Remote Changes
```bash
git pull origin main
```

### Step 3: Apply Performance Fixes

Create a new file: `src/PerformanceConfig.js`

```javascript
export const PerformanceConfig = {
    // User-configurable performance settings
    enableAtmosphericFog: false,  // DISABLED by default
    enableWeather: false,          // DISABLED by default
    maxWeatherParticles: 300,      // REDUCED from 1000
    enableSpatialAudio: true,      // Minimal cost
    enableCompanionMapMarkers: true, // Minimal cost
    
    // Auto-detect based on FPS
    autoDisableFog: true,
    fpsThreshold: 30,
    
    // Load from localStorage
    load() {
        const saved = localStorage.getItem('longNights_performanceConfig');
        if (saved) {
            Object.assign(this, JSON.parse(saved));
        }
    },
    
    save() {
        localStorage.setItem('longNights_performanceConfig', JSON.stringify(this));
    }
};
```

Then modify `src/VoxelWorld.js` to use it:

```javascript
import { PerformanceConfig } from './PerformanceConfig.js';

// In constructor:
PerformanceConfig.load();

// When initializing systems:
if (PerformanceConfig.enableAtmosphericFog) {
    this.atmosphericFog = new AtmosphericFog(/*...*/);
} else {
    this.atmosphericFog = null;
    console.log('⚠️ Atmospheric fog disabled (Performance Config)');
}

if (PerformanceConfig.enableWeather) {
    this.weatherSystem = new WeatherSystem(/*...*/);
} else {
    this.weatherSystem = null;
    console.log('⚠️ Weather disabled (Performance Config)');
}
```

### Step 4: Test and Tune

1. Run game with all systems disabled
2. Enable one at a time
3. Measure FPS impact
4. Decide which to keep based on your hardware

---

## Expected FPS Impact

Based on the new systems, expected FPS drop:

| Configuration | Expected FPS (vs baseline) |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| **All Systems ON** | -15 to -25 FPS |
| **Fog + Weather OFF** | -2 to -5 FPS |
| **Everything OFF (like local)** | ~Same as current |

If your laptop currently runs at 60 FPS:
- With all new systems: ~35-45 FPS (playable but not smooth)
- With fog/weather off: ~55-58 FPS (barely noticeable)
- With everything off: ~60 FPS (same as now)

---

## Conclusion

**Good News:**
- Remote has BETTER structure spawn rates (2% vs your 5%)
- Remote has bug fixes (tree stamina)
- Your local additions (pyramids, igloos) are already in remote
- No fundamental rendering changes to core engine

**Bad News:**
- Remote added 3 major rendering systems (fog, weather, enhanced UI)
- These are performance-heavy on lower-end GPUs
- They're enabled by default

**Solution:**
- Pull remote changes
- Disable fog and weather by default
- Add performance config system
- Let users opt-in to fancy graphics
- Keep fast performance as default

**Merge Conflict Risk:** LOW - your changes (pyramids, igloos, spawn rates) are already in remote, so merge should be clean.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Backup your work** (git stash or branch)
2. **Pull remote** (git pull origin main)
3. **Apply performance fixes** (disable fog/weather)
4. **Test FPS** with console commands
5. **Commit performance config**
6. **Optional:** Add settings UI for users to toggle features

Would you like me to create the actual code patches for the performance fixes?

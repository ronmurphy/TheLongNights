# üèîÔ∏è Mountain Dungeon System - Development Log

**Started:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** Phase 1 - Detection System  
**Current Version:** In Development

---

## üìã Development Phases

### Phase 1: Mountain Detection ‚úÖ IN PROGRESS
**Goal:** Identify tall stone plateaus in the world

**Status:** Basic scanner implemented  
**Files Created:**
- `src/MountainDetector.js` - Scans chunks for mountain formations
- Console commands added to `CONSOLE_COMMANDS.md`

**How It Works:**
1. Scans chunks around player every 5 seconds
2. Looks for areas with height >= 20 blocks
3. Checks for 5+ consecutive stone blocks (plateau depth)
4. Marks locations as mountain candidates

**Test Commands:**
```javascript
// Force immediate scan
voxelWorld.mountainDetector.scanNearbyPlayer();

// See what was found
voxelWorld.mountainDetector.getAllMountains();

// Get stats
voxelWorld.mountainDetector.getStats();
```

### Phase 2: Hollow Mountain Generation (NEXT)
**Goal:** Convert detected plateaus into hollow mountains with bedrock shell

**Design:**
- Bedrock shell is INTERIOR LINING (not solid fill!)
- Hollow center for dungeon
- Gateway entrance (3x3 opening)
- Remove trees on plateau

**Implementation Plan:**
1. When mountain detected ‚Üí mark as "needs hollowing"
2. On next chunk generation:
   - Keep exterior stone shell (2-3 blocks thick)
   - Fill interior with bedrock (hollow shell, not solid!)
   - Clear trees from surface
   - Create gateway entrance

---

### Phase 3: Dungeon Interior (FUTURE)
**Goal:** Procedural dungeon generation inside hollow mountains

**Design from MOUNTAIN_DUNGEON_SYSTEM.md:**
- Perlin worm pathfinding
- Bedrock wall detection
- Vertical shafts (use the height!)
- Boss rooms
- Loot chests

---

## üêõ Current Issues & Notes

### Understanding Current Terrain:
- Mountains are **plateaus** (5-6 blocks high)
- Made of stone blocks
- May have trees on top (can remove)
- Biome system: `BiomeWorldGen.js`
- Mountain height: min=15, max=30 (with super mountains up to 60!)

### Clarifications:
- ‚úÖ Bedrock is **INTERIOR SHELL** not solid fill
- ‚úÖ Keep stone exterior (natural mountain appearance)
- ‚úÖ Remove trees before hollowing
- ‚úÖ Scan for "mostly stone" chunks

---

## üìä Detection Stats (Once Implemented)

After running in-game:
```javascript
voxelWorld.mountainDetector.getStats()
// Returns:
// {
//   totalDetected: 5,
//   lastScanTime: 1729372800000,
//   isScanning: false,
//   config: { ... }
// }
```

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test detection** - Run game, find mountains, check console
2. **Verify detection accuracy** - Are we finding real plateaus?
3. **Design hollowing algorithm** - How to replace interior without breaking surface?
4. **Create MountainHollower.js** - Worker or main thread?

---

## üí° Design Questions to Resolve

1. **When to hollow?**
   - During chunk generation (worker)?
   - After detection (main thread)?
   - On-demand when player approaches?

2. **How to mark chunks?**
   - Store in localStorage?
   - In-memory only?
   - Chunk metadata?

3. **Gateway placement?**
   - Random side of mountain?
   - Always south-facing?
   - Multiple entrances?

4. **Tree removal?**
   - Before or after hollowing?
   - Just on plateau or whole mountain?

## üß™ Testing Plan

### Phase 1 Testing (Detection):
- [ ] Start game
- [ ] Explore until you find a mountain biome
- [ ] Open console (F12)
- [ ] Run: `voxelWorld.mountainDetector.scanNearbyPlayer()`
- [ ] Check: `voxelWorld.mountainDetector.getAllMountains()`
- [ ] Verify: Does it detect the stone plateau?

### Phase 2 Testing (Hollowing):
- [ ] TBD

### Phase 3 Testing (Dungeons):
- [ ] TBD

**Log:** Mountain detection system integrated, ready for initial testing!

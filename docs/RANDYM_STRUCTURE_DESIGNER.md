## 🎨 Current Capabilities

### What Works Now

1. **Visual Editor**: Clean 3D isometric view with grid
2. **Block Placement**: Click to add oak_wood blocks
3. **Height Stacking**: Blocks snap to grid and stack properly
4. **Block Removal**: Right-click any block to delete it
5. **Preview System**: Blue ghost block shows placement location
6. **Statistics**: Real-time block count display
7. **Zoom**: Mouse wheel adjusts camera zoom (0.5x - 3x)

### Limitations (Phase 1)

- ❌ Only oak_wood blocks available (no selector yet)
- ❌ No rotation controls (camera locked to isometric)
- ❌ No shape tools (manual placement only)
- ❌ No save/load functionality
- ❌ No undo/redo
- ❌ No EnhancedGraphics integration yet

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### File Location
```
/src/ui/RandyMStructureDesigner.js
```

### Integration Points
- **VoxelWorld.js**: Import (line 32), initialization (line 320)
- **Global Function**: `window.openStructureDesigner()` (line ~7185)
- **Help Output**: Added to debug commands (line ~7448 in showCommands())

### Memory Management
The designer properly cleans up:

## 🎯 Alpha Testing Goals

**What you want to learn:**

1. **Performance** - Does it run smoothly? (target: 60 FPS)
2. **Balance** - Too hard? Too easy? Boring?
3. **Bugs** - What breaks? Edge cases?
4. **Clarity** - Do players understand what to do?
5. **Fun** - Do they want to keep playing?

**What to ask testers:**

- "How long did you play before stopping?"
- "What was most fun?"
- "What was most frustrating?"
- "Did anything feel broken/unfinished?"
- "Would you play more if this was finished?"

## ✅ Pre-Mountain-Dungeon Release Advantages

**Why release NOW instead of waiting for mountain dungeons:**

1. **Validate core gameplay** - Is the loop fun?
2. **Find bugs early** - Better now than after adding dungeons
3. **Test performance** - Baseline before adding complex systems
4. **Build hype** - Testers can see progress when dungeons added
5. **Manage scope** - Mountain dungeons are BIG, need feedback first

**Post-Alpha Roadmap:**
```
Alpha → Feedback → Bug fixes → Mountain dungeons → Beta
```

---

## 🚀 VERDICT: **SHIP IT!**

This is a **SOLID alpha release** because:

✅ Core systems work  
✅ 20-30 hours of content  
✅ Clear gameplay loop  
✅ Performance optimized  
✅ No memory leaks  
✅ Save system stable  
✅ Tutorial onboards players  
✅ Enough polish to feel "real"  

**Mountain dungeons are the cherry on top**, not the foundation. Your game is already fun without them!

## 📝 Next Steps

1. ✅ Do 5-10 minute test run (checklist above)
2. ✅ Write RELEASE_NOTES.md for testers
3. ✅ Document known issues (Sargem editor, etc.)
4. ✅ Create bug report template
5. ✅ Ship to testers! 🚀

**Then:** Wait for feedback, fix critical bugs, add mountain dungeons, release beta!

**My recommendation: This is ready for alpha testers NOW.** 🎉

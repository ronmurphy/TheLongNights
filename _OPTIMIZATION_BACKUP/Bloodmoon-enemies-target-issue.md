You're absolutely right - it's 1:35am and you need sleep! Let me document all the changes I made so you can pick up where we left off in the morning.

## Summary of Changes Made Tonight

### üéØ **Problem Identified**
- Right-click ranged weapons (ice_bow, crossbow, throwing_knives, fire_staff, spear) weren't working on Blood Moon enemies
- Your insight was correct: Blood Moon system predated ranged weapons, so targeting was never properly implemented
- Red reticles worked (BlockOutlineSystem could detect enemies) but right-click didn't fire projectiles

### üîß **What I Implemented**

#### 1. **EntityPool System** (NEW FILE: EntityPool.js)
- **Purpose**: Object pooling for enemy sprites to reduce garbage collection during Blood Moon (100+ enemies)
- **Features**:
  - Reuses sprites instead of creating/destroying them
  - Shares textures across all enemies of same type (massive memory savings)
  - Creates invisible mesh hitboxes for reliable raycasting (like ColoredGhostSystem)
  - Pool size limits: 200 total sprites, 50 per entity type

#### 2. **BloodMoonSystem Integration** (MODIFIED: BloodMoonSystem.js)
- **Changed**: 
  - `spawnEnemy()` now uses `entityPool.acquire()` instead of `new THREE.Sprite()`
  - `removeEnemy()` now uses `entityPool.release()` instead of disposing sprites
  - Animation system updated to use pooled texture references
  - Added EntityPool cleanup in dispose method

#### 3. **VoxelWorld.js Mouse Targeting** (MODIFIED: VoxelWorld.js)
- **Changed**: 
  - Added entity hitbox position detection logic (lines ~12167-12175)
  - Added entity prioritization in raycasting (lines ~12160-12175) 
  - Added debug logging to track targeting issues

### üêõ **Current Status**
- **PARTIALLY WORKING**: Far enemies can be targeted and shot
- **STILL BROKEN**: Close enemies are detected but position calculation is wrong
- **Debug Output Shows**: 
  ```
  üéØ DEBUG: Prioritized entity hit: troglodyte at distance 25.0
  üéØ DEBUG: Right-click on mesh/block, using hit point: (23.8, 2.1, 7.7)
  ```
- **Issue**: EntityPool hitboxes are detected but `entitySprite` reference might be broken

### üìã **Your Morning Game Plan Options**

#### Option A: **Complete Current Approach** (30-60 min)
- Fix EntityPool `entitySprite` reference in `resetSprite()` method
- The foundation is solid, just need to debug the position calculation

#### Option B: **Your Unified Enemy System Idea** (2-3 hours)
- Create a single enemy management system that uses ColoredGhostSystem's proven targeting code
- All enemies (Blood Moon, Spectral Hunt, etc.) use the same hitbox system
- This might be cleaner long-term but requires more refactoring

#### Option C: **Simple Quick Fix** (15-30 min)
- Just copy ColoredGhostSystem's hitbox creation code directly into BloodMoonSystem
- Skip EntityPool for now, get targeting working first
- Add EntityPool performance optimization later

### üìÅ **Files Modified Tonight**
1. **NEW**: EntityPool.js (385 lines) - Complete object pooling system
2. **MODIFIED**: BloodMoonSystem.js - Integrated EntityPool usage
3. **MODIFIED**: VoxelWorld.js - Added entity targeting priority and position logic

### üîÑ **To Revert Everything** (if you want clean slate):
```bash
git stash  # Save current work
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Go back one commit
```

### üí° **My Recommendation for Tomorrow**
Go with **Option C** first - get basic targeting working using ColoredGhostSystem's proven approach, then add EntityPool performance optimization once targeting is solid. The performance gains are nice but targeting functionality is more important.

Sleep well! The foundation we built tonight is solid - just need to iron out that last position calculation bug. üåô
